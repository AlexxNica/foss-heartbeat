Does saying "thanks", "thank you", or "thx" have an impact on whether new contributors come back?
 - Not for whether they come back once
 - What about whether they become an "above average" committer?

Step 2: What about issue reporters?
Step 3: What about for users that are completely new to participating on github?

Not being thanked means slightly greater chance of coming back (38.6%-42.8% vs 43.3%-45.2%)

rails/rails (issue reporters)
-----------------------------

one additional report:
Number of first time contributors exposed to word: 2027
Number of first time contributors exposed to word that contributed again: 592
Number of first time contributors NOT exposed to word: 19207
Number of first time contributors NOT exposed to word that contributed again: 5729

two additional reports:
Number of first time contributors exposed to word: 2027
Number of first time contributors exposed to word that contributed again: 292
Number of first time contributors NOT exposed to word: 19207
Number of first time contributors NOT exposed to word that contributed again: 5729

Note the drop off in contributors again. Perhaps maintainers know who is new,
and they're more likely to be polite and thank them?
