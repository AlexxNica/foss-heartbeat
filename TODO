1. GET ALL THE DATA!!!! (And document the date I pulled the data on)

2. Find the project's bots.

3. What was a user's first interaction with a project?
   - open an issue
   - comment on an issue
   - open a PR
   - comment on a PR

   For each user, record their username, the issue ID, issue/pr/comment date, and what type of interaction it was.
   Double check this against the list of people github says are contributors

4. What roles have they achieved?
   - Issue reporter (opened an issue that was closed)
   - Issue responder (commented on an issue that was not their own)
   - Code contributor (opened a PR that was merged)
   - Documentation contributor (opened a PR including a doc file that was merged)
   - Reviewer (commented on a PR that was not opened by them)
   - Maintainer (merged another person's PR)
   - Connector (tagged someone else that's not a bot, who commented)

5. From their initial interaction with a project, how long did it take them to achieve that role?

6. What length of time did they take that role on (first action to last action)?

7. During their time in that role, was their average number of actions in that role per month?

8. Are they active now in that role?

(Note: 5,6,7,8 can be visualized with a dot chart)
