Open source communities are made of people, who contribute in many different
ways. What makes a person more likely to continue participating in a project
and move into roles of greater responsibility?

This project identifies seven major contribution types:
 - Issue reporter
 - Issue responder
 - Code contributor
 - Documentation contributor
 - Reviewer
 - Maintainer
 - Connector

This project uses contributor participation data (currently from github) to
categorize users into these roles, and then perform data analysis to answer
questions about what factors attract and retain those types of contributors.

There are many different questions you could ask once you can categorize
contributors and examine their contributions. The first goals of this project
is to answer the question:

What impact does positive or negative language have on contributor
participation?

This project seeks to answer that question by applying sentiment analysis on
the comments community members make on others' contributions.
